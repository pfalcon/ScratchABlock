    "A really crude approach is to split every variable at every basic-block
    boundary, and put Ï†-functions for every variable in every block"

    The algorithm below already contains an obvious optimization - phi
    functions are inserted only to blocks with multiple predecessors. Note
    that this requires rename function to process basic block from successors
    to predecessors, to correctly propagate renamings thru such phi-less
    blocks. (If on the other hand we inserted phi's to each block, we could
    process their renaming in arbitrary order, because each basic block would
    have its local definition for every variable).
